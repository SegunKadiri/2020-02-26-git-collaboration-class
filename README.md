Git training for collaboration

- `clone` : "downloading" a repository from a remote to a computer
  - You only need to do this once. Just like the `init` command
- `branch <name>`: create a branch called <name>
  - `checkout <name>` or `switch <name>`: to move `HEAD` (i.e., switch) to that branch
  - This is a test on commit on a different branch
  - `push <branch>` `pull <branch>`: we need to be more mindful which branch we want to push/pull and not automatically to master
  - This is an assignment to add a new branch
